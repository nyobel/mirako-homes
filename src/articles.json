        "mins": "6",
        "content": "Recently, I wrote an article on the best interior designs to incorporate into your home as a tenant. I read a couple of articles and found common ideas for creative and affordable designs to use.\nC.R.E.A.T.I.V.I.T.Y and A.F.F.O.R.D.A.B.I.L.I.T.Y are the factors that influenced my choice of this article. While the internet has the best and worst interior designs, the worst designs often boil down to personal taste.\nFrom avoiding white furniture or overindulging in golden accents, different interior designers have different opinions. For me, I keep this simple to 5 ugly interior decor. This is not an outdated thing, though it may be personal.\nSo, this article is unique from the other \"worst interior deco\" articles for my taste. That's why I use the word \"ugly\" for my title; worse is a disservice to my opinion.\nFactors You Should Consider When Choosing Interior Designs\n• Defying the rules- improvise\n• Your Lifestyle\n• Your space\n• Symmetry\n• Simplicity\n• Blend textures\nRead more about factors to consider when choosing your interior designs.\n# 1 Using Newspapers on Walls and Ceilings\nI recently visited a friend's house, and numerous pictures of beautiful ladies were cut out from newspapers. With further messages from the newspaper; \"love me or leave me.\" I found this too rustic and obnoxious.\nWhy commit this disgrace to your home.\n# 2 Using Cowhide Prints\nCowhide prints are some items some people find to be the in-thing. People often use cowhide prints in furniture and carpets.\nIt is a popular trend, but I find it ridiculous to have the skin of a cow in your home.\n# 3 Overusing the Brown Color\nHow much space are you working with?\nBrown is notorious for bringing warmth into a room. But excessive use, especially in a small room, brings darkness. Moreover, it needs many contrasting colors to make it attractive, which is difficult in small spaces.\n# 4 Using Plastic Stands and Furniture\nPlastics are an affordable option compared to a wooden pantry table. But Wooden pantry tables are more durable.\nPlus, there is a hype to reduce plastics. Plastic stands add more trash to the environment in the long run. Additionally, plastics are uncomfortable because they lack the warmth of natural materials.\n# 5 Converting your Home into a Forest\nIn my article, I mention a few of the best interior plants.\nPlants infuse nature into your house. However, you want just enough plants to beautify your space rather than turning it into forestry.\nBonus Point\nWhen going for plastic, choose from a minimalistic design that is simple and timeless. These plastics should be made from eco-friendly furniture.\nWhy Stick to 5 Ugly Designs?\nI kept my article short because my taste largely influenced the article. My prior article on the best interior décor all boils down to infusing the house with your taste. Interior design also has to blend in with your lifestyle.\nBeing innovative with your personal touch is, therefore, crucial. To have affordable decos, some people go overboard by picking irking designs. You should create laughter and warmth in your home and avoid deco that stirs humor from their eccentric taste.\nShould you go for minimalist or warm colors? What are the boundaries to these colors which make them cloyed or gaudy?\nThe answer is relative: personal taste, personal taste, personal taste.\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.mosaicslab.com/blog/5_worst_interior_design_trends_of_2022/\nhttps://www.graana.com/blog/do-we-need-to-ditch-plastic-furniture-in-2024/\n",

        "content": "After numerous searches, finding the \"perfect\" home is still arduous. This is because rental houses are different from an owner's house. After all, your own house follows your precise liking. Additionally, rented houses have the limits of rules in the lease agreement.\nYou may forego your deposit if you break these rules. However, you can still add a personal touch to a rental house, shifting it from a house to a home. Primarily, your decorative choice should resemble your personality and lifestyle. Therefore, you create memories using your style.\nWhat You Need to Know Before Crafting Your Interior Design\nYou should carefully read the rental agreement to stick to the rules. Additionally, choose designs that are suitable to the lease term. For example, painting dark colors may be hectic if you intend to stay for a short duration because of the tones of colors it will take to paint it to the house’s original state. Therefore, the designs should be temporary and easy to remove. Lastly, ensure that the design is within your budget.\n#1 Add Wall Designs\nWalls are essential to the interior design because they define the home. Luckily, there are numerous options to choose from. Removable peel-and-stick wallpapers are an affordable option to use. Alternatively, you can paint accent walls. For this style, you can go for a bold or subtle design. Additionally, you may paint your walls. Lastly, you can add art and paintings that spruce up the wall.\n\n#2 Use Stylish Storage\nSuch includes using an open shelf. Open shelves add appeal and create visual interest. Open shelves enable you to see the wall which creates more interest.\nStorage baskets and belly baskets are also on trend. You can incorporate its numerous shapes and patterns into different layouts.\n#3 Avoid Using Nails When Hanging Artwork\nUse command hooks and strips to hang artwork and mirrors. Removable shelves are also a great idea because they are not drilled.\n#4 Delineate Space\nThe soaring prices of houses in the urban areas make it essential to be creative with the limited space around you. Create unique definitions by setting the small spaces right. You may group furniture sets such as those in the dining room. This outlines and segregates different areas of your house.\nAlternatively, you can differentiate the area with new furniture sets and design elements such as moveable bookshelves, screens, ottomans, and jaali partitions.\nUse thinner paper or fabric to allow light to pass through. Heavier partitions may block light and sound.\n#5 Use Indoor Plants\nGreeneries infuse life and tranquility into your home. Greeneries are also an affordable and easy way to spruce up your house.\nYou can choose from various options such as hanging planters, freestanding plants, and adhesive hooks. However, choose plants whose branches only occupy little space or creep. These plants include ZZ Plants, money plants, ferns, kentia palm, swiss cheese plants, coffee plants, peace lilies, and snake plants.\n\n#6 Use Flooring Accessories\nFlooring accessories include rugs and carpets. They are a great way to add flair to a defective floor and protect it from damage. Rugs and carpets also add vibrancy, warmth, and texture. You can choose from designs such as woolen rugs and luxurious and contemporary flooring.\nYou can also incorporate artificial grass into your balcony.\n\n#7 Redecorate the Windows and Doors\nChange your curtains to geometric patterns and use satin drapes and rolling shutters. Using window treatments such as sheers and curtails may prevent UV lights that fade furniture. Window treatments help to create a more polished look. Therefore, window treatments help prolong your furniture’s lifespan.\nYou can add new paint or use new door designs such as veneer finish doors for the doors.\n\n#8 Use Functional Modular Furniture\nThis furniture takes up moderate space. Therefore, they are ideal in a limited space. Modular furniture is an excellent choice for renters who are versatile and adaptable. You can also easily arrange the furniture to suit different needs and spaces. It is also easy to create various configurations and layouts.\n\n#9 Update Your Cabinetry\nYour kitchen space may need to be more congested and updated. You can create novelty by lighting the under-cabinet to illuminate it. You can also recreate the cabinet's look by adding new knobs and pulls and putting on wallpapers.\n#10 Use Different Decorative Lighting Options\nThese include LED lights, chandeliers, pendant lights, and floor lights. Alternatively, you can renovate old switches and plugs by adding new colors or using wooden radiators. For example, an acrylic board with fixed patterns and lights adds flair to your ceiling.\nMood lighting is also a great way to add intensity, warmth, and color to a room. This switches things from a functional and harsh ambiance to a friendly ambiance.\n\n#11 Buy Multi-Functional Furniture\nMulti-functional furniture serves various needs and helps save space. An example is a sofa bed which is a bed by day and at night.\n\n#12 Refurbish the Furniture\nYou can upgrade your furniture to blend with the look you have in mind. You may go for a rustic or a contemporary style. You may get rid of old furniture, repaint the furniture, or use slipcovers. Hence, use furniture with removable covers and cushions. Alternatively, you can design your home to rhyme with the old furniture.\n#13 Invest in Mirrors\nMirrors give the illusion of space and light. Place a mirror near a window to amplify light and make the room airier.\n\nBonus Point\nBe creative when arranging your home. Using vertical spaces such as bookcases and shelving units helps save on space. Additionally, you can take advantage of the space behind the door and use under-bed storage containers.\nAlso, consider the size of the bed in proportion to the room. Massive beds consume too much space.\nWrapping Up\nIt is easy for tenants to feel limited by a rental house design that needs to be spot on to their taste. But remember that the floor, walls, and other permanent designs don’t constitute a home. Your job is to create beautiful memories from your decorative style. Several temporary designs help add specialties and your unique personality. Therefore, these designs shift a house or a building structure to a home.\nLearn more about how to decorate a home at Mirako Homes.\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.livspace.com/in/magazine/decor-ideas-rental-home\nhttps://www.designcafe.com/blog/home-interiors/interior-design-ideas-for-rented-home/#:~:text=For%20contemporary%20design%20themes%2C%20youdecals%20to%20pep%20things%20up.\nhttps://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/decorate/a35093246/decorating-rented-home/\nhttps://www.bobvila.com/articles/best-renter-friendly-decor/\nhttps://www.loveproperty.com/gallerylist/72808/land",
